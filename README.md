## :warning: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :warning:
Just to cover my ass
# Note
This is quick and dirty and just 'works', I reccomend this fork that has a little more attention to detail

# Flashforge-for-Cura

Just download the master zip and drop the files into your cura install folder NOT THE APPDATA (You need admin access) 
Linux: ~/.local/share/cura/4.6
MacOS: ~/Library/Application\ Support/cura/4.6
Windows: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\cura\4.6

OR
**use the installer under the releases section of GitHub (reccomended)**.
This will add the flashforge printer to your cura add printer under the Flashforge tab you have to install the GPX plugin to make it work
