# Flashforge-for-Cura

Just download the master zip and drop the files into your cura install folder NOT THE APPDATA (You need admin access) OR **use the installer under the releases section of GitHub (reccomended)**.
This will add the flashforge printer to your cura add printer under the Flashforge tab you have to install the GPX plugin to make it work
